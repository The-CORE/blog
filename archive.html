<p >I'm now almost two years, and an actual discrete mathematics course, ahead of my apparently-bored-towards-the-end-of-high-school-self, and I'm feeling ready to replace <a href="\infinity-trees" >my old mistakes</a> with some fresh new ones. So below are at least some of the reasons I think I was wrong last time, which I will delve into in this post.</p>
<ol >
<li >The diagonal argument is quite clearly order agnostic, and just kind of really good in general.</li>
<li >I didn't define a bijection.</li>
<li >There are no irrationals until you get infinitely far down the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p >Well, quite a few more than there are integers apparently. Uncountably many.
Which makes sense really, because it isn't particularly easy to count them.</p>
<blockquote >
<p >Well, we start with zero.<br />
Then there is zero point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...<br />
Damn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p >But, I have thought up a system of accessing them which is confusing me,
because I think it might map every real number between zero and one to a unique
integer.</p>
<p >Or maybe it doesn't. Infinity is complicated, irrationals are weird, and I
didn't really do enough research.</p>
<p >I'm also not very good at marketing.</p>
