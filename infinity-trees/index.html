    <h2>How many numbers are there between zero and one?</h2>
<p>Well, quite a few more than there are integers apparently. Uncountably many.
Which makes sense really, because it isn't particularly easy to count them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we start with zero.<br />
Then there is zero point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...<br />
Damn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>But, I have thought up a system of accessing them which is confusing me,
because I think it might map every real number between zero and one to a unique
integer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Or maybe it doesn't. Infinity is complicated, and I didn't really do enough
research.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm also not very good at marketing.</p>

    <h2>The Diagonal Argument</h2>
<p>A typical argument given for there being more numbers between zero and one is
Cantor's Diagonal Argument. It is undoubtable put much better by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0">Numberphile</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA">Vsauce</a>, but below I shall attempt
to describe it as well.</p>
<p>When (a \ne 0), there are two solutions to (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$</p>
