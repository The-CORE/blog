## How many numbers are there between zero and one?
Well, quite a few more than there are integers apparently. Uncountably many.
Which makes sense really, because it isn't particularly easy to count them.

But, I have thought up a system of accessing them which is confusing me,
because I think it might map every real number between zero and one to a unique
integer.

Or maybe it doesn't. Infinity is complicated.  
And I'm not very good at marketing.
