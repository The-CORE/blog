## The Diagonal Argument

A typical argument given for there being more numbers between zero and one is
Cantor's Diagonal Argument. It is undoubtable put much better by
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument),
[Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0), and
[Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA), but below I shall attempt
to describe it as well.

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
