## A by No Means Necessarily Remotely Complete Look at Some of the Ways in Which I Was Wrong

I'm now almost two years, and an actual discrete mathematics course, ahead of my apparently-bored-towards-the-end-of-high-school-self, and I'm feeling ready to replace [my old mistakes](\infinity-trees) with some fresh new ones. So below are at least some of the reasons I think I was wrong last time, which I will delve into in this post.

1. The diagonal argument is quite clearly order agnostic, and just kind of really good in general.
2. I didn't define a bijection.
3. There are no irrationals until you get infinitely far down the tree.
