* No mater what actually exists you could consider it a sequence of numbers. Maybe.
* You could find many patterns that apparently describe those numbers, leading to many interpretations of the realities based on the sequence.
* Any of them might become invalid after the next 'number' in the 'sequence', but, they only need to be valid for the moment. For the moment in which we live. And maybe you can even take subsets of the sequence.
