<p >I'm now slightly more than a year, and an actual discrete mathematics course ahead of my apparently-bored-towards-the-end-of-high-school-self, and I'm feeling ready to replace <a href="\infinity-trees" >my old mistakes</a> with some fresh new ones. So below are at least some of the reasons I think I was wrong last time, which I will delve into in this post.</p>
<ol >
<li >The diagonal argument is quite clearly order agnostic, and just kind of really good in general.</li>
<li >I didn't define a bijection.</li>
<li >There are no irrationals until you get infinitely far down the tree.</li>
</ol>

    <h2 id="the-diagonal-argument" >The Diagonal Argument</h2>
<p >As I said last time, the diagonal argument goes a little like this...</p>
<blockquote >
<p >Let $s$ be the set of all real numbers between zero and one.<br />
For each of the positive integers, pick a random member of $s$, and never
repeat.<br />
Write these out, in binary, with all the infinite digits of each real.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
$s_1$: $0.100111010...$<br />
$s_2$: $0.011111110...$<br />
$s_3$: $0.100111000...$<br />
$s_4$: $0.110101000...$<br />
$s_5$: $0.010100000...$<br />
$s_6$: $0.000010011...$<br />
$s_7$: $0.110001101...$<br />
$s_8$: $0.100100011...$<br />
$s_9$: $0.111100111...$<br />
$...$<br />
<br />
Then, you take the first digit of the first number, the second digit of the
second number, the third of the third, and so on, and make a new number by
inverting these digits (turning $0$s to $1$s and $1$s to $0$s).<br />
<br />
i.e.<br />
$s_1$: $0.\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}00111010...$<br />
$s_2$: $0.0\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}1111110...$<br />
$s_3$: $0.10\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{0}}111000...$<br />
$s_4$: $0.110\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}01000...$<br />
$s_5$: $0.0101\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{0}}0000...$<br />
$s_6$: $0.00001\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{0}}011...$<br />
$s_7$: $0.110001\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}01...$<br />
$s_8$: $0.1001000\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}1...$<br />
$s_9$: $0.11110011\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{\mathbf{1}}...$<br />
$\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{...}$<br />
Highlighted digits: $\color{rgb(0, 255, 51)}{110100111...}$<br />
$\therefore$ the new numbers is: $0.001011000...$<br />
<br />
However, this number is different from every number in the list above in at
least one way.<br />
<br />
So, we have not indexed every item in $s$, despite using all the positive
integers.<br />
<br />
And therefore, as there are the same number of integers as there are
positive integers, there are more numbers between zero and one, than there
are integers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Now this looks rather conclusive. And as it turns out, perhaps unfortunately for my past self, it is.</p>
<p >See, I had looked at arguments for the countability of the rationals (mirrored in <a href="/infinity-trees#intervals" >my "intervals" argument</a> that seemed to function by simply looking at the numbers in a different way, and so I became convinced that my tree could be a way of looking at the numbers in a different way that allowed them to be counted.</p>
<p >However, fortunately for his diagonal argument, Cantor cares not from whence the sequence comes. In my example I said to pick from the reals in a random order, but that is by no means required. You could pick from the reals in <em >any</em> order. The actual diagonal argument (and not my failing mimicry) very delibrately does not prescribe the order in which you try to write out the rationals. There <em >are</em> more reals than integers, and no new way of looking at it I invent is going to change that.</p>
<h2 id="bijections" >Bijections</h2>
<p >Additionally, as if that wasn't enough, I want to extend on something I touched on last time, but clearly didn't understand fully: bijections.</p>
<p >I clearly had some sense that only being able to go from integers to "reals", and not the other way was a problem:</p>
<blockquote >
<p >Unfortunately though it is only one way. It only goes from non-negative integers to reals, not the other way around. This argument would be much more conclusive if it could go the other way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Though I clearly didn't understand why, or how to articulate it, what I seem to have been trying to argue last time was that I had found a bijection from the integers to the reals. To delve into what these means exactly we will have to deal a little with how we formalise functions.</p>
<p >So, if we have a function $f: A \rightarrow B$</p>
<h2 id="distance-down-the-tree" >Distance Down the Tree</h2>
<p >And thirdly I want to discuss an idea</p>
<h2 id="and-another-thing" >And Another Thing</h2>
<p >Me assuming that I had to build functions out of well known elementary functions</p>
