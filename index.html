            <p>Just some words about some things. A blog by James Wright,     a member of the species homo-sapiens, who happens to call Sol 3 home.</p>

    <p><h2>How many numbers are there between zero and one?</h2>
<p>Well, quite a few more than there are integers apparently. Uncountably many.
Which makes sense really, because it isn't particularly easy to count them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we start with zero.<br />
Then there is zero point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...<br />
Damn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>But, I have thought up a system of accessing them which is confusing me,
because I think it might map every real number between zero and one to a unique
integer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Or maybe it doesn't. Infinity is complicated. I certainly didn't do remotely
enough research.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm also not very good at marketing.</p>
